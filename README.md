# Amazing Box Generator
## Description
This was the final project for the JavaScript: An Introduction course offered by
the Oâ€™Reilly School of Technology. The application asks for the name, color, and number
of boxes to be generated. It then draws the specified number of boxes with the entered
attributes randomly in the browser window. The user is then able to click on any of the
boxes to receive information about that box.
## Installation
To run the application, copy all the files to the same folder and open the boxes.html
file in a web browser.
